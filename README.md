# regdel
Ncurses based interface to ledger: regdel is to ledger what tig is to git.

Ledger (http://ledger-cli.org/) is a command line double-entry accounting
system.

Regdel allows to browse your accounts and entries from a ledger file.  I got
the inspiration from the excellent git interface tig
(https://github.com/jonas/tig).

Bug report and patches are welcome.  I only tested it on my own ledger files,
so it might not work very well on other files.
